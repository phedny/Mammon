	    Mammon is a distributed IOU management system, capable of
	    running in daemon mode on a server and also able to run on
	    a mobile phone. A peer-to-peer network between servers
	    allows (circular) debts to be resolved, while the mobile
	    application allows users to issue and transfer IOUs
	    without requiring an active internet connection.

	    Etymologically, the word <em>Mammon</em> assumed to derive
	    from Late Latin 'mammon', from Greek '&mu;&alpha;&mu;&mu;&omega;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;', Syriac
	    'm&aacute;m&oacute;na' meaning riches and was an Aramaic loan word in
	    Hebrew meaning wealth or possessions, although it
	    may also have meant 'that in which one trusts'.

	<div id="history" class="span4">
	  <h2>History of Money</h2>
	  <p>
	    Money has changed it's guise many times over the course of
	    its history. <em>Mammon</em> is just an other manifestation.

          <p>
            One thing that students often do together is having diner. Some
            days this means cooking a meal somewhere, other days this means
            ordering some food online or eating out at a restaurant. At first,
            everybody pays for themselves, causing a visit to a restaurant to
            always end with a lot of shuffling of cash money to make sure
            things work out. After a while, some persons start to accept debt
            from others to smooth the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            When several people hold debt which each other, people will start
            creating administrations of those debts. When using proper
            bookkeeping practices, it's possible to see what any person owes
            you and it's possible to see what you owe. Multiple entries with
            a single person can be netted, allowing mutual debts to be
            crossed out.
          </p>
          <p>
            This works pretty well, but there are a couple of disadvantages
            of keeping your own administration without any connection to other
            people:
            <ul>
              <li>
                When a new debt is issued, both persons have to update their
                administration. Since administrations aren't linked -- and
                one might even be on paper -- mistakes might go unnoticed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any mismatch that seems to occur must be manually resolved.
              </li>
              <li>
                Circular debts involving more than two persons aren't easily
                solved without giving other people insight into your personal
                administration file.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Several online websites exist that allow a group of people to
            keep a centralized debt administration. Some of these sites even
            allow circular debt to be resolved, but they all rely on a
            central server to maintain the administration. Some disadvantages
            of using such websites have been identified:
            <ul>
              <li>
                All members in a group must agree on a single website to use.
                All members must feel confident in the availability of the
                website, the backup strategy that is being used and must trust
                the website to be honest.
              </li>
              <li>
                A single person may belong to more than one social group in
                which he or she performs debt administration. When those groups
                don't use the same website, this person must maintain an
                account on both websites. Additionally, circular debts that may
                be resolved globally, might not be resolvable on the two
                isolated websites.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a website to administer debts required an internet
                connection to be available to issue new debts. While such a
                connection may be assumed domestically, it may be unavailable
                during a period of network failure or when travelling abroad.
              </li>
            </ul>
