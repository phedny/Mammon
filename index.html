	  <p>
	    Mammon is a distributed IOU management system, capable of
	    running in daemon mode on a server and also able to run on
	    a mobile phone. A peer-to-peer network between servers
	    allows (circular) debts to be resolved, while the mobile
	    application allows users to issue and transfer IOUs
	    without requiring an active internet connection.

	  <h2>What's In A Name</h2>
	  <p>
	    Etymologically, the word <em>Mammon</em> assumed to derive
	    from Late Latin 'mammon', from Greek '&mu;&alpha;&mu;&mu;&omega;&nu;&alpha;&sigmaf;', Syriac
	    'm&aacute;m&oacute;na' meaning riches and was an Aramaic loan word in
	    Hebrew meaning wealth or possessions, although it
	    may also have meant 'that in which one trusts'.

	  <h2>History of Money</h2>
	  <p>
	    Money has changed it's guise many times over the course of
	    its history. <em>Mammon</em> is just an other manifestation.

          <p>
            One thing that students often do together is having diner. Some
            days this means cooking a meal somewhere, other days this means
            ordering some food online or eating out at a restaurant. At first,
            everybody pays for themselves, causing a visit to a restaurant to
            always end with a lot of shuffling of cash money to make sure
            things work out. After a while, some persons start to accept debt
            from others to smooth the process.
          </p>
          <p>
            When several people hold debt which each other, people will start
            creating administrations of those debts. When using proper
            bookkeeping practices, it's possible to see what any person owes
            you and it's possible to see what you owe. Multiple entries with
            a single person can be netted, allowing mutual debts to be
            crossed out.
          </p>
          <p>
            This works pretty well, but there are a couple of disadvantages
            of keeping your own administration without any connection to other
            people:
            <ul>
              <li>
                When a new debt is issued, both persons have to update their
                administration. Since administrations aren't linked -- and
                one might even be on paper -- mistakes might go unnoticed.
              </li>
              <li>
                Any mismatch that seems to occur must be manually resolved.
              </li>
              <li>
                Circular debts involving more than two persons aren't easily
                solved without giving other people insight into your personal
                administration file.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            Several online websites exist that allow a group of people to
            keep a centralized debt administration. Some of these sites even
            allow circular debt to be resolved, but they all rely on a
            central server to maintain the administration. Some disadvantages
            of using such websites have been identified:
            <ul>
              <li>
                All members in a group must agree on a single website to use.
                All members must feel confident in the availability of the
                website, the backup strategy that is being used and must trust
                the website to be honest.
              </li>
              <li>
                A single person may belong to more than one social group in
                which he or she performs debt administration. When those groups
                don't use the same website, this person must maintain an
                account on both websites. Additionally, circular debts that may
                be resolved globally, might not be resolvable on the two
                isolated websites.
              </li>
              <li>
                Using a website to administer debts required an internet
                connection to be available to issue new debts. While such a
                connection may be assumed domestically, it may be unavailable
                during a period of network failure or when travelling abroad.
              </li>

          <h2>Trading with IOUs</h2>
          <p>
            Let's say a friend of you paid for a beer and you owe him two
            euros for it. You can "formally" declare this debt by writing a
            statement saying "I owe you 2 euros." Any time in the future, your
            friend can present you your promise and claim 2 euros. For any
            practical purpose, all you care about is that you have to pay
            someone 2 euros when your promise is presented; it may be the friend
            you wrote the promise to or someone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            This means that your friend is in a position that he can sell the
            statement -- which we call IOU -- to anyone that has enough trust
            in you keeping your promise. This is the basis of trading with
            IOUs.
          </p>
          <p>
            When your friend holds your 2 euro IOU and has also written an 2 
            euro IOU to some other person, his balance is effectively zero.
            In practice, however, he must still pay back his debt when this
            third person asks a redemption on the IOU. Your friend may therefore
            want to sell your IOU to this third person in exchange for
            redemption of his IOU.
          </p>
          <p>
            When this third person knows and trusts you,
            he may agree. The balance of your friend stays at zero after the
            trade, but now he doesn't have any obligation to pay back anyone,
            while you still owe someone 2 euros. The person that now holds your
            2 euro IOU has a promise from you to pay back 2 euros.
          </p>
          <h3>Circular debt</h3>
          <p>
            Let's assume your friend never sold your 2 euro debt to this third
            person and also that you hold a 2 euro IOU issued by this person.
            This current situation is that three persons hold each others debts
            in such a way that a circle has been created. In Mammon, this is
            called circular debt. While you all three effectively have a zero
            balance, you must all keep your promise when IOUs are redeemed.
          </p>
          <p>
            When your friend sells your IOU to this third person, he no longer
            holds any IOUs and also doesn't have any debts. You and this third
            persons now only hold IOUs of each other. The special case of
            circular debt where the circle only contains two persons is called
            mutual debt. By simultaneously redeeming IOUs that both persons
            hold, this debt can also be resolved.
