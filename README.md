Mammon
======

[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/phedny/Mammon.png?branch=master)](http://travis-ci.org/phedny/Mammon)

Mammon is a distributed IOU management system, capable of running in daemon mode on a server and also able to run on a mobile phone. A peer-to-peer network between servers allows (circular) debts to be resolved, while the mobile application allows users to issue and transfer IOUs without requiring an active internet connection.

The protocol and crypto are based on a publication by [Stefan Brands][Br93].
